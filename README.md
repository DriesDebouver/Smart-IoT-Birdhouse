# Smart IoT Birdhouse

## Smart Internet of Things Birdhouse based on a Raspberry Pi
Birdhouse with a camera that records video's when motion is detected inside.
Video's are saved on a ownCloud storage server running on the Raspberry Pi.
You can check the temperature and humidity inside the birdhouse and the temperature outside with help of two sensors.
The Raspberry Pi has a battery and solar panel so it doesn't need power.
The Raspberry Pi is configured as a acces point/gateway so it doesn't need a internet connection but serves as a network to connect with.
When you come near the birdhouse with a device you can connect on the network, go on the ip address from the Raspberry Pi and acces the videos in the cloud.

### Parts:
Raspberry Pi 4 with a camera module, pir motion sensor and two temperature sensors.
